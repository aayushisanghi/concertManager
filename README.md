Finding concerts youâ€™d potentially enjoy is not easy! It involves finding artists similar to the ones you enjoy on Spotify, finding their concerts on different platforms (especially for smaller artists, concerts may not be listed on all platforms), and then going to websites like setlist.fm to view their setlist. Further, it is not easy to compare prices and other attributes in one place. It would be a lot more easy and fun to have a pipeline that pulls data from all these platforms to orchestrate your concert experience!
